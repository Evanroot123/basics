# basics
Working on the basics: data structures, algorithms, fun little games/tools.

Using the visual studio command line compiler.
Using vim as the text editor, trying to get good with it to see how it feels when I know all the hotkeys.
Using vs2022 as debugger when I get stuck, although I want to check out the Remedy debugger as recommended
